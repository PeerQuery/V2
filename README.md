# V2(Only served as Proof of Concept)
Depreciated version(Proof of Concept) of Peer Query

This code was trimmed down from the v1 which had DB support and other "advanced" features. For this reason you may find random snippets of unrelated / uncompleted codes in it.


## How to run it
In the json.package file you will find all the dependiaries which are:
* express
* sitemap
* body-parser

##What you should know

**This version is only a Prrof of Concept so does not include all the features for a full site.**
This site runs on Steem Connect v2 so to use it you MUST have your own Steem Connect v2 app - not account.

## The following features work:
* Steem Connect v2 login
* Voting post and comment with slidebar
* Responding/ Commenting
* Resteeming a post
* Limited users profile
* Viewing any Steem post using the permlink - not just "queries"

## What does NOT exist:
* Threaded comments
* Parsing content with Makrdown parser
* Auto linking of images, profile and youtube videos

## Its all yours for re-use!
Do whatever you want with it. You are responsible for whatever you do with it.

## Recommendation
The alpha version is very professional, rich in interface design(Sematic UI) and a STILL open source. If you are considering forking Peer Query, you might want play with this version to understand the workings of Peer Query and then fork the alpha for production work.
